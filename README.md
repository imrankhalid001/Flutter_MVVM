<h2>MVVM Architecture and Libraries with SOLID Principle</h2>

<p>
  This Flutter application is built using the <strong>MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)</strong> pattern and adheres to the <strong>SOLID</strong> principles to ensure a clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase. The following libraries are utilized in this project:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>fluttertoast</strong>: For displaying non-intrusive toast notifications.</li>
  <li><strong>http</strong>: For making HTTP requests to interact with RESTful APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>another_flushbar</strong>: For customizable and versatile flushbar notifications.</li>
  <li><strong>provider</strong>: For state management and dependency injection.</li>
  <li><strong>shared_preferences</strong>: For persistent local storage to save user preferences and data.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  By leveraging these libraries and architectural patterns, the application achieves a robust and efficient structure, facilitating ease of development and future enhancements.
